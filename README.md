OpenStudio-229RPDGenerator


This repository provides the application and source code for a compliance wizard which allows users to select OpenStudio .osm files, enter additional compliance details, and create and pre-validate RPD json files for use with the ASHRAE Standard 229 Ruleset Checking Tool (RCT).

Please note that this project is currently in its initial stages of development. It is not yet operational for practical use. We are actively working on its development and enhancement. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome as we progress towards a fully functional version. Stay tuned for updates and feel free to explore the existing codebase.

Using the OpenStudio-229RPDGenerator

Setup:
    1. The Openstudio-229RPDGenerator contains OpenStudio measures which requires the OpenStudio CLI to run,
    which be installed through the OpenStudio app, please see here: https://openstudiocoalition.org/getting_started/getting_started/
    
    Please ensure that when you are installing the app that you are also installing the CLI.
    
    2. The Openstudio-229RPDGenerator requires Python3 and Ruby 3.2.2 installed

    3. Run `bundle install` to install Ruby dependencies

    4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install Python dependencies



1. Run command

python .\createOSRulesetProjectDescription.py create_cp_csv --openstudio_model_path "./test_files/Test_E1.osm" --weather_file_name "USA_CO_Denver.Intl.AP.725650_TMYx.epw" --convert_input_format_exe_path "C:\EnergyPlusV24-2-0\ConvertInputFormat.exe"

Where:
--openstudio_model_path is the path to the openstudio model ie "./test_files/Test_E1.osm"
--weather_file_name "USA_CO_Denver.Intl.AP.725650_TMYx.epw" ie a weather file places in the directory weather
--convert_intput_format_exe_path, The path to the EnergyPlus utility ConvertInputFormat ie "C:\EnergyPlusV24-2-0\ConvertInputFormat.exe"

where  filename.osm is osm to process, this command will generate a csv 
filename_cp-empty.csv

2. Open filename_cp-empty.csv, enter values in the compliance parameter value column, these values will be read back into the comp-param json

3. Run the command 

Developing the OpenStudio-229RPDGenerator


This package is developed using Pipenv to manage packages during the build process. First, make sure Pipenv is installed on your system using the following commands. Any new dependencies that are added to the package must be included in the Pipfile. The package is currently being developed for Python 3.11. IMPORTANT - 32-bit version of Python must be installed on your machine and selected as your interpreter for Pipenv to work properly.

Install pipenv using pip with the following command. pip install pipenv

All project dependencies can be installed with the following command. pipenv install --dev

Developer Notes
GitFlow
Long-running branches include the default branch development, and the production branch main. All other branches are short-lived branches that should be deleted after merging into development. The development branch will merge into the main branch only for major releases.

Branch and Pull Request naming convention:
The branch or PR name should have the form: FEATURE/INITIALS/DESCRIPTOR
FEATURE is one of the following:

ENG: (Engine) for changes related to core algorithms and data structures
RI: (Read Input) for changes related to the processing of DOE-2 input files
RO: (Read Output) for changes related to the processing of DOE-2 output files
GUI: (Graphic User Inteface) for changes related to the application interface
REF: (Refactoring/Reference) for changes related to nonfunctional attributes of the software (renaming files or variables, restructuring files or directories, or functions related to processing of DOE2/schema reference documentation)
INIITIALS refers to the initials of the owner of the branch or PR.
